"Due to our use of more modern distribution platforms such as Steam, itch.io, "
"Flathub, and others, players will be automatically upgraded to a new stable "
"series for the first time since Wesnoth was released. To support this, an "
"option will be shown the first time 1.16.0 is started after being upgraded "
"from 1.14.17 to migrate settings as well as download the 1.16 version of any "
"add-ons that are installed, if they have been updated to work with 1.16.  To "
"go along with that, Wesnoth is now able to select save files from previous "

"Addressing a long standing pain point, especially for players with slow "

"the entire add-on being redownloaded - instead only the files that have "
"actually changed will be downloaded - which will significantly reduce both "
"the time it takes to update add-ons as well as how much data is used when "
"updating. Additionally, any version of an add-on that has been uploaded by "
"the author in the last 30 days is selectable for download, thus allowing for "
"downgrading an add-on if needed for any reason."
